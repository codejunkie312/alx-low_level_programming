* converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.
# `void print_binary(unsigned long int n);`
* prints the binary representation of a number.
# `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);`
* returns the value of a bit at a given index.
# `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`
* sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.
# `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`
* sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
# `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);`
* returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
